## Disclaimer: 
I'm currently working full-time as a fullstack developer (backend expertise) and as a devops engineer at WeDev Technologies Ltd.
I'm also the founder and CTO of Matchscanner which is currently being under development.

### The organization contains:

#### Discord bot
- Built on discord.js and its 100% in typescript.
- Allows version control of branch creating, pull request creating, jira integration and progresses the jira tasks by the users actions (tech design/in progress/dev deploy) stages.

#### Web main app (wip)
- An attempt to make the players/matches finding process easier, concentrated and friendly across a variety of games and platforms.
- Front: Mainly React.ts, Redux@toolkit.
- Backend: Express, MongoDb (stripped and 100% modifiable and scalable unlike "mongoose" solutions etc.) - Contains nice development features as script manager, jobs manager etc.
- Both front and back are 100% typescript.

#### Dashboard app
- Controls values, assets, parameters, users that exist on the app.
- Applies full environment (version) control by seperation of Development/Production environments.
- Fullstack app that uses the same technologies as the main app.

## **The repositories are private due to "StartUp" state - but don't worry they are there.**
## **You cannot see my contribution because the discord bot is submitting all the contributions and pr's as an Admin user.**
